      In 2024, I had the chance to finally go on a year-long trip around the
      world with my partner‚Äîa goal I‚Äôd been thinking about for a long time. It
      was an unforgettable experience that took me through 13 different
      countries: the United Arab Emirates, Japan, Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand,
      Australia, New Zealand, the United States, Costa Rica, Chile, Argentina,
      Peru, and Ecuador.

      Each place had its own unique moments and lessons. When I got back, I
      wanted a way to ease back into coding while also documenting this
      adventure and any future travels I might take. That‚Äôs what led me to
      create this app. If you‚Äôre interested in the technical details of how it‚Äôs
      built, feel free to keep reading below.

  <p class="m-6 text-justify">
    This project is a classic web app built around a UI ‚Üí API ‚Üí Database
    architecture.
  </p>

  <p class="m-6 text-justify">
    The API layer is developed with Fastify and designed for flexibility, using
    Awilix for dependency injection (DI) management. DI is essential here, as it
    makes testing and local development easier (especially with Docker) and
    allows for greater architectural flexibility when swapping components.
  </p>

  <p class="m-6 text-justify">
    On the backend, I rely heavily on AWS services, including CloudFront,
    Cognito, API Gateway, Lambda, ECS, S3, SQS, SNS, and DynamoDB, along with
    infrastructure essentials like VPCs, secrets management, and CloudFormation.
    All infrastructure is defined using CloudFormation YAML files. For local
    development I use Localstack to fake AWS services integration.
  </p>
  <i class="m-6 text-justify">
    <strong>note:</strong> below there's a diagram of the AWS architecture for
    this project and how everything ties together.

  <p class="m-6 text-justify">
    On the frontend, the UI is built with Angular 19 and uses Ngrx Signal Store
    for state management, with RxJs handling asynchronous operations like image
    uploads and API calls. Although I have used frameworks like Angular Material
    in the past, this time I went with Tailwind CSS (even though I'm still using
    Angular Material CDK for stuff like dialogs). Other key libraries include
    Angular OIDC for Cognito OAuth authentication and Google Maps.
  </p>

  <p class="m-6 text-justify">
    There‚Äôs still a lot or work to do, this is a work in progress
    (<strong>*cough*&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;tests&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;*cough*&nbsp;</strong>better
    responsiveness/accessability,<strong>&nbsp;*cough*&nbsp;</strong> the list
    goes on...). Still, it accomplishes it's main goal so it's MVP...kind off
