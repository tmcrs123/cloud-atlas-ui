      In 2024, I had the chance to finally go on a year-long trip around the world with my partner‚Äîa goal I‚Äôd been thinking about for a long time. It was an unforgettable
      experience that took me through 13 different countries: the United Arab Emirates, Japan, Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, Australia, New Zealand, the United States, Costa Rica,
      Chile, Argentina, Peru, and Ecuador.

      Each place had its own unique moments and adventures. When I got back, I wanted a way to ease back into coding while also documenting this adventure and any future travels I
      might take. That‚Äôs what led me to create this app. If you‚Äôre interested in the technical details of how it‚Äôs built, feel free to keep reading below.

  <h1 class="text-4xl text-center">üöÄ&nbsp;Technicalities</h1>

  <p class="text-justify">This project is a classic web app built around a UI ‚Üí API ‚Üí Database architecture.</p>

  <p class="text-justify">
    The API layer is developed with Fastify and designed for flexibility, using Awilix for dependency injection (DI) management. DI is essential here, as it makes testing and local
    development easier (especially with Docker) and allows for greater architectural flexibility when swapping components.
  </p>

  <p class="text-justify">
    On the backend, I rely heavily on AWS services, including CloudFront, Cognito, API Gateway, Lambda, ECS, S3, SQS, SNS, and DynamoDB, along with infrastructure essentials like
    VPCs, secrets management, and CloudFormation. All infrastructure is defined using CloudFormation YAML files. For local development I use Localstack to fake AWS services
    integration.
  </p>
  <i class="text-justify"> <strong>note:</strong> below there's a diagram of the AWS architecture for this project and how everything ties together. </i>

  <p class="text-justify">
    On the frontend, the UI is built with Angular 19 and uses Ngrx Signal Store for state management, with RxJs handling asynchronous operations like image uploads and API calls.
    Although I have used frameworks like Angular Material in the past, this time I went with Tailwind CSS (even though I'm still using Angular Material CDK for stuff like dialogs).
    Other key libraries include Angular OIDC for Cognito OAuth authentication and Google Maps.
  </p>

  <p class="text-justify">There‚Äôs still a lot or work to do, this is a work in progress. Still, it accomplishes it's main goal so it's MVP...kind off üê±‚Äçüèç</p>
